# Todo application

## Description

This application is a chess timer.

Each player has an associated timer of which they can play their moves. When started, one player's timer begins to count down to 0.

Hitting "Switch" rotates the counter to begin to decrement the other player's timer.

When either player's timer hits 0, both timers pause and a winner message is displayed.

## TODO

- Make the .custom-button-container-lg buttons smaller and more click-able
